# Clean Code Comment Standards

## Context
- These rules ensure comments add value
- They promote self-documenting code

## Requirements
1. Always try to explain yourself in code
2. Don't be redundant
3. Don't add obvious noise
4. Don't use closing brace comments
5. Don't comment out code
6. Use as explanation of intent
7. Use as clarification of code
8. Use as warning of consequences

## Examples
<example>
// Good: Comment explains why, not what
// Retry 3 times due to occasional network instability
async function fetchUserData(userId: string) {
  return await withRetry(3, () => api.getUser(userId));
}
</example>

<example type="invalid">
// Bad: Redundant comment
// This function gets the user
function getUser(id: string) { // gets user by id
  return users.find(u => u.id === id);
}
</example>

## Critical Rules
- NEVER write comments for obvious code
- ALWAYS explain the why, not the what
- NEVER leave commented-out code
- ALWAYS keep comments up to date
