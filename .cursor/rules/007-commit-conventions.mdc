# Commit Message Conventions

<version>1.1.0</version>

## Context
- These rules apply to all commit messages in the project
- They ensure a clear and searchable commit history
- They facilitate automated changelog generation
- They promote consistency across the development team
- They incorporate Gitmoji for visual representation of change types

## Requirements

### Commit Structure
- Use the Conventional Commits format: `<type>(<scope>)[!]: :<gitmoji>: <description>`
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Write description in imperative, present tense (e.g., "add" not "added")
- Use the body to explain what and why, not how
- Reference issues and pull requests at the end of the body
- Include a blank line between the description and body
- Include a blank line between the body and footer

### Commit Types and Corresponding Gitmojis
- `feat`: `‚ú®` (`:sparkles:`) ‚Äì A new feature
- `fix`: `üêõ` (`:bug:`) ‚Äì A bug fix
- `docs`: `üìù` (`:memo:`) ‚Äì Documentation changes
- `style`: `üíÑ` (`:lipstick:`) ‚Äì Changes that don't affect code functionality (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: `‚ôªÔ∏è` (`:recycle:`) ‚Äì Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: `‚ö°Ô∏è` (`:zap:`) ‚Äì Performance improvements
- `test`: `‚úÖ` (`:white_check_mark:`) ‚Äì Adding or correcting tests
- `build`: `üõ†Ô∏è` (`:hammer:`) ‚Äì Changes affecting the build system
- `ci`: `üë∑` (`:construction_worker:`) ‚Äì Continuous Integration related changes
- `chore`: `üîß` (`:wrench:`) ‚Äì Changes to build process, dependencies, etc.
- `revert`: `‚è™Ô∏è` (`:rewind:`) ‚Äì Reverting changes

### Commit Scope
- Use scope to indicate the component affected (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`)
- Keep scope names consistent across commits
- Use lowercase for scope names
- Omit scope for changes that affect multiple components

### Breaking Changes
- Mark breaking changes with `!` after type/scope: `feat(api)!: ‚ú® change authentication API`
- Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body with explanation
- Provide migration instructions when possible

### Body
- Provide a detailed explanation of the commit
- Begin one blank line after the description
- Use imperative, present tense
- Explain the "why" and "what" of the change, not the "how"

### Footer
- Include metadata such as breaking changes and issue references
- Begin one blank line after the body
- Each entry starts on a new line
- For issue references, use format: `Refs: #<issue-number>` or `Fixes: #<issue-number>`
- For review references, use format: `Reviewed-by: <reviewer>`

### Language Standards
- Write all commit messages in English
- Use clear and concise language
- Avoid technical jargon unless necessary
- Be specific about what changed

## Examples

<example>
# Good commit message with Gitmoji

feat(auth): ‚ú® implement JWT authentication

- Add JWT token generation and validation
- Create authentication middleware
- Update user repository to support token storage

Fixes: #123
</example>

<example>
# Good commit message with breaking change

feat(api)!: ‚ú® change response format to follow JSON:API spec

- Updated all API endpoints to use new format
- Created serializers for consistent output

BREAKING CHANGE: API responses now follow the JSON:API specification.
All response objects are now wrapped in a data property and include
type and id fields.

Migration guide: https://example.com/api-migration-guide
</example>

<example>
# Good commit message with review reference

docs(readme): üìù update installation instructions

Updated installation instructions to include Docker setup.

## Critical Rules

<critical>
- NEVER use vague commit messages
- ALWAYS follow the Conventional Commits format with Gitmoji
- ALWAYS write in English using imperative, present tense
- NEVER mix multiple unrelated changes in a single commit
- ALWAYS include the appropriate Gitmoji for the commit type
- ALWAYS mark breaking changes with ! and BREAKING CHANGE: footer
